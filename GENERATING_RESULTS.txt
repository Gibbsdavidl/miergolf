Computing edge weights
----------------------

The first step involves computing sum-lag-transfer-entropy weights for the
edges, and permutation testing the weights.

Computing weights without permutation testing:

(after changing directory into miergolf)

python src/TESum.py data/Eser_Averaged_Expression.txt.gz data/yeast_array_genesymbols.csv.gz data/Yeastmine_shortlist.txt.gz testout.txt 10 6 3 10 0.1 ABF1 BET2 2

This script takes the following parameters:
exprfile = the expression data, samples in columns
genefile = the gene names for each row
edgefile1 = the list of edges, as tab separated genes
fileout  =  name of the output file
gridsize = 10 works well
ylmax    = in the paper, set as 6
reps1    = First cut, number of permutations ... get rid of insignficant edges early.
reps2    = Used number of permuations. In the paper 50,000.
thresh1  = Transfer entropy must be above this value.
g1 =       gene name one
g2 =       gene name two
cpus =     ants in parallel

The output:

g1      g2      robustDist      observedTE      permuted TE 1   permuted TE 2   permuted TE 3    ...
ABF1	BET2	3.85778447514	1.27504986326	0.743789335983	0.743789335983	0.614501119523	0.614501119523	0.49904265996 ...

----------------
Permutation Test
----------------

In each result line, column 5 to the end are SLTE values from permuted data.

Edges were accepted if sum( res0[5:ncol(res0)] > res0[4] ) < (1 / length(c(5:ncol(res0))+1)) 

------------------------------------------
Solving the Influence Maximization Problem
------------------------------------------

With the output of SLTE, as above, we should have a file formated "gene_A \t geneB \t SLTE \n".
I have saved this weighted network file as "data/yeastmine_signif_te.net".

The parameter sets used in the paper are found at:
utils/misc/slow_params_sweep_K.py
utils/misc/fast_params_sweep_K.py

If only a single value of K (the set size) is desired, we run:

python src/main.py data/ant_config.txt data/yeastmine_signif_te.net

This produces results for a single value of K (the set size).

The results look like:
Config	Graph	Type	OptimTo	Mode	Nodes	Ants	Tx	Rx	Damp	Local	Score	Touch	Soln	Wt	Nodes
data/ant_config.txt	data/yeastmine_signif_te.net	regular	score	tx	1147	32	0.0001	0.0001	0.99	4	429.633310502	425	[313, 475, 341]	4.63331050242	FKH1-FKH1:GCN5-GCN5:RFX1-RFX1


Config	The configuration file
Graph	The graph file name
Type	The graph type (regular or a line graph)
OptimTo	Value to use for optimization (The ant's score).
Mode	Can be transmit (tx), recieve (rx), or both .... only used Tx here.
Nodes	Number of nodes in the graph
Ants	Number of ants used
Tx	    Transmit threshold, to be counted for graph coverage
Rx	    Rx threshold, to be counted for graph coverage
Damp	Dampening on the graph weights.
Local	Number of steps of local optimization. 24 is a good selection.
Score	The resulting optimized score
Touch	Number of nodes touched, or the graph cover
Soln	The numerical index of nodes used in the solution.
Wt	    The sum of edge weights
Nodes   The node names used in the optimized solution.


-------------------
Automating the runs
-------------------

The parameter sets used in the paper are found at:
utils/misc/slow_params_sweep_K.py
utils/misc/fast_params_sweep_K.py

But I encourage playing around with the parameters to see how results are affected.

arguments to the sweek_K / varyK scripts are:
path_to_miergolf = args[0]
graphname = args[1]
outputpath = args[2]
cpus = int(args[3])

Run it like:
python utils/varyK.py path/to/miergolf data/yeastmine_signif_te.net output/path/ 4

---------------------
That's it!
